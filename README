cmalloc
=======

This is a configurable malloc. At initialisation, user provides it two pieces
of information:

1. all possible allocation sizes and
2. optionally, expected frequency of allocations for each allocation size.

Then, when allocating memory using cmalloc() the caller supplies an identifier
for one of the allocation sizes configures at initialisation. cmalloc will
find the best slot which minimises fragmentation.
